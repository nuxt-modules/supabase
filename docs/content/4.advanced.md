## Realtime

Based on [Supabase Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime), listen to changes in your PostgreSQL Database and broadcasts them over WebSockets. 

To enable it, make sure you have turned on the [Real Time API](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api#realtime-api-1) for your table.

Then, listen to changes directly in your vue page / component:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import type { RealtimeSubscription } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const client = useSupabaseClient()
let subscription: RealtimeSubscription

// Fetch collaborators and get the refresh method provided by useAsyncData
const { data: collaborators, refresh: refreshCollaborators } = await useAsyncData('collaborators', async () => {
  const { data } = await client.from('collaborators').select('name')
  return data
})

// Once page is mounted, listen to changes on the `collaborators` table and refresh collaborators when receiving event
onMounted(() => {
  subscription = client.from('collaborators').on('*', () => {
    refreshCollaborators()
  }).subscribe()
})

// Don't forget to unsubscribe when user left the page
onUnmounted(() => {
  client.removeSubscription(subscription)
})
</script>
```

## Auth middleware

You can protect your authenticated routes by creating a custom composable in your project, here is an example:

```ts [middleware/auth.ts]
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, _from) => {
  const user = useSupabaseUser()

  if (!user.value) {
    return navigateTo('/login')
  }
})
```

Then you can reference your middleware in your page with:

```ts [pages/dashboard.vue]
definePageMeta({
  middleware: 'auth'
})
```
