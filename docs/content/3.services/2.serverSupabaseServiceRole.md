::warning
This section assumes you're familiar with [Nitro](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/server-engine), the server engine powered by Nuxt.
::

This function is designed to work only in [server routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-routes), there is no vue composable equivalent.

It works similary as the [serverSupabaseClient](/services/serversupabaseclient) but it provides a client with super admin rights that can bypass your [Row Level Security](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security).

> The client is initialized with the `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (recommended) or `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (deprecated) you must have in your `.env` file. We recommend using the new JWT signing keys (`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`) as described in the [Supabase blog post](https://supabase.com/blog/jwt-signing-keys).

Define your server route and just import the `serverSupabaseServiceRole` from `#supabase/server`.

```ts [server/api/bypass-rls.ts]
import { serverSupabaseServiceRole } from '#supabase/server'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const client = serverSupabaseServiceRole(event)

  const { data } = await client.from('rls-protected-table').select()

  return { sensitiveData: data }
})
```

Then call your API route from any vue file:

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const fetchSensitiveData = async () => {
  const { sensitiveData } = await useFetch('/api/bypass-rls')
}
```
